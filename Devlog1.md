## Experimenting with Logo

I used Apple LOGO II for the first time and had a lot of fun using it. You input the differnet commands in the bottom of the screen and transforms the image. For example, you tell it to translate 30 pixels right, and it will do that. I tried making a design reminiscent of 80’s designs. I would like to try to make more, or even try to make interesting patterns. The pattern created was, to me, reminiscent of a simulation in an 80’s movie. In particular, it made me think of movies like Tron. It could also be seen similar to the interface in Star Wars, like the x-wing or tie fighter.  This makes sense, as tyhis was probably simialr to the technology at the time, so it gives off the same effect. The 80’s style has always been a favorite of mine, so I would definitely like to make more in the future.
