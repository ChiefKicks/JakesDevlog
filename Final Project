##Final Project Devlog



For my final project I wanted to create a procedurally generated game that would be different whenever you played it. It would spawn in a random enemy type every set amount of seconds. There is a score meter at the bottom so the player can see points. It almost works as an endless mode for a game like duck hunt. 

I had a multitude of issues when programming the final. In particular the spawning in of enemies. I would get issues where objects wouldn't register, or would only flash on the screen for a split second.After getting help from my professor, I was able to get the game to procedurally generate enemies constantly every 2 seconds. 

I made little bit-art sprites for each of the enemies. While they may look ugly, I like them a lot. There is the standard orange fish, the basic enemy type. There is the yellow fish with a faster movement speed than the other fish, and lastly there is the big purple pufferfish, that bounces with a force of gravity. The game functions by spawning in one of three options. These options are...

-3 orange fish
-3 yellow fish
-2 purple fish

There is also the chance for all three enemy types to spawn at once.


Even though it may look somewhat janky, I feel the game is a fun little toy that can go on forever. I plan on modifying the game further in the future to add more variety to the enemy types and movement of enemies.
