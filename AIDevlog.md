_Find your own examples or check Discord for examples of artificial life (aka a-life) or a project exploring emergence that you have found that relates to the ideas in this text. 
 This could either be from an artwork, a computer program or a real life process. Investigate it further online. How does it demonstrate emergence/bottom-up design?
 (Also, be sure to explain what emergence means to you)._

While trying to understand the concept of Artificial Life, I read an article from “The Gradient”, titled, “Introduction to Artificial Life for People who Like AI”. 
To my understanding, it is coding a program or creature that acts as though it is alive, or would mean it would, “respond to stimuli, adapt to its environment, reproduce and 
transfer imperfect information to its offspring” (Sinapayen). An example I have seen is on the [video from two-minute papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ2bqz3HPJE). 
I believe this is artificial life, coupled with various programming changes. The system is seen learning how to walk over time, and the programmers are trying new ways to group 
these muscles together. 


According to a quote from The [NSF](https://nsf2026imgallery.skild.com/entries/emergence-complexity-from-the-bottom-up), Emergence can be defined as,

> “When parts of a system interact by simple mechanisms to create complex collective behavior impossible for any individual component.”

To me it means when small aspects combine and create a more complex mechanism, like various muscle programs combining to create a walking man. 
When turning my most recent program into an array, it just gave me a lot of cats that chased the red dot, however, they all eventually reached the same speed and orbit, 
combining them into one.
