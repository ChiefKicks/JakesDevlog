I would want to make a program that creates art based on music played. The artists could play it on the spot or the program could take audio tracks and make art based on it.
A certain shape for drum beats, and colors for guitar riffs. Almost painting with sound. It would probably function with keys pressed being linked to certain sounds and inputs.
It would also involve certain sound pitches being linked with certain shapes and shades. Every key pressed would act as a stroke on the canvas.
If I were to make this, it would probably be named something in regards to “synesthesia” because you are seeing sounds on a canvas.
I am not sure if this name would be at all offensive, so it would be open to change.
I am not sure what issues could arise from this program, but I could go in and play notes for the program if the audio track doesn’t register. 



“No paint” was a fun program to create with. I would consider it my artwork, as I chose how it moved and what it made.
Allowing the program to pick shapes and choosing my own allowed for an enjoyable experience. The randomness added a degree of fun into it and not knowing what comes next. 
I will be sure to include more randomness into my artwork, as it added a new variable into the creation. 
In life, randomness is good in moderation, as it is important to have stability.
