Similar to last but with the code of

I had a good experience using Hydra, I thought it was very fun and interesting. 
These patterns I see most commonly in things like visualizers. In fact, my designs were made with a retro design in mind. 
I’d consider the language intuitive and different to p5js. The language overall makes sense but it’s uses are very different to p5js. 
As stated prior, I see hydra as a visualizer and a program that should be used with music as opposed to p5js which I see as having much more flexibility in possible creations.
