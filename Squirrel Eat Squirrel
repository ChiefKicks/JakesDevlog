For the “Squirrel Eat Squirrel” game we made, there was a set process of things we did, especially early on. 
First we created the playable squirrel that moves with WASD. Then, we made an array of NPC squirrels that spawn in different places, move and have various sizes. 
However there have been collision issues that have been a hassle. Various things were attempted to fix the issue, including reformatting all of the objects to vectors. 
Splicing also wouldn’t function, even after various attempts to get it working. In terms of design choices, we went for a hellscape/lava theme. 
One could say it was slightly reminiscent of Doom, just in a setting aspect. 
We also looked to include stage hazards for the player, being patches of fire on the ground that would end the game when touched. 
While at this moment, there is still some work that needs to be finalized with some help from our professor, the status of the game is almost completed. 
The game has environmental hazards, sounds, a nice background. Smaller squirrels will make you grow and large squirrels will end the game, but you need to be wary of the fire. 
In conclusion, I feel we did a great job in the time allotted.
