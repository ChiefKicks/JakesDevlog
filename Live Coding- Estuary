Sadly I wasn't able to livecode with any classmates this week, as I had no real time.
However my expierence from class was really good, and made me really open to trying more live coding.
I also used the estuary a bit by myself to try out out making solo beats. It was a very fun expierence, 
trying to mix and match and what terrible rhythms were possible.
When I get more time after midterms, I will be willing to try and live code with others more.
These lines make pretty good beats
-every 1 (rev) $ sound "kurt kurt  [kurt kurt kurt]"
-every 1 (rev) $ sound "bd*2 [bd [sn sn*2 sn] sn]"
