I would make certain animals move at various speeds that correlate with the real animals. For example, eagles soar above all others, while the bison has a slow trot in the plains.
The pronghorn moves quickly in the fields. Other types of animals I could include or examine are the fly, which could buzz around a small area very quickly. 
I could also examine turtles and their extremely slow walk. Frogs would leap in a curved line, going on an arch. 
In the basic code, I put several bison and pronghorn, as they typically move in herds. There are many possibilities to code wildlife and have it behave how it would.
